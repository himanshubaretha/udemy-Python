    "### calculate_min_moves Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: This function calculates the minimum number of moves required to align students with seats.\n",
    "Sorting: Sorting the seats and students lists ensures that the closest seat is paired with the closest student.\n",
    "Absolute Difference: The abs() function is used to calculate the distance between a seat and a student, regardless of whether the seat is to the left or right of the student.\n",
    "Summation: The sum() function adds up all the distances to get the total moves required.\n",
    "main Function:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input Handling: The input is read as a single string, split into a list of strings, and then converted into integers.\n",
    "Parsing:\n",
    "The first number (n) represents the number of seats and students.\n",
    "The next n numbers are the positions of the seats.\n",
    "The following n numbers are the positions of the students.\n",
    "Function Call: The parsed data is passed to the calculate_min_moves function to compute the result.\n",
    "Output: The result is printed to the console.\n",
    "Input Format:\n",
